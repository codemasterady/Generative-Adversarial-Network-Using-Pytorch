This notebook will guide you through the journey of understanding Generative Adversarial Networks or (GANs) for short. However, before diving into this monster of a concept, we must understand the main concept between the GANs i.e, the main purpose of them. You can think of GANs as a  two-player [**minimax**](https://www.baeldung.com/java-minimax-algorithm) game where the generator (Generative) tries to fool the discriminator (the adversary) into thinking that what the generator is producing is indistinguishable from whatever real object we are trying to train the discriminator for. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of a minimax game, don't worry, we will cover it in the subsections to come. Now that we understand the main *purpose* of the GAN let's dive into it in more detail !!!
